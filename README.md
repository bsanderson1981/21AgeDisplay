# 21AgeDisplay
display html page of date someone needs to be born to purchase alcohol at 21 year of age.  If born after
date showm   NO SALE TODAY.

I have not put any cache breaking logic.  So if your system caches browser data. It may not 
display correct date. 

I added this to my POS display so staff could hit a button to show correct date to check
photo id's against for customer that purhcase alcohol in my cafe.  We are not a high 
volume store  for alcohol sales.
